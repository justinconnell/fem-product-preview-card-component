## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite development workflow automation
- Mobile-first implementation approach

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at using Vite, React and Tailwind CSS for a project 
which proved to be quite a steep leaning curve. For this challenge I referenced
the Tailwind CSS docs and React docs to get started. 

Using Vite made the whole dev environment simple to set up and operate, 
I will continue using Vite to drive my frontend dev workflow.

Because Tailwind CSS is a utility framework, it took some getting used to for me,
this is the first time I took the approach of stringing together small utility classes 
to produce a design implementation. At first, I was pretty slow at getting results
because I had to go between the docs and the editor for each class, as I got used to 
the Tailwind way, I found that I could cope more intuitively with the help of intellisense.

I'm still in the process of learning React and used this challenge to provide a practical 
implementation of the basics.

### Continued development

I plan to continue using Vite and React, as for Tailwind CSS, I believe it's worth keeping 
up developing experience in rapid prototyping but I will be focussing more on developing 
skill in Sass(scss).

### Useful resources

- [React srcset for Responsive Images](https://crystallize.com/blog/react-srcset-for-responsive-images) - helped me get a handle on src sets and screen size orientated image loading.
- [Complete Intro to React, v8](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/) - Gave me the base to build from for this challenge.
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - installing and configuring Tailwind CSS.
